    <h1>Debugging Challenge</h1>
    <p>
      The purpose of this task is to find errors in JavaScript part of the code.
    </p>

    <script>
      // This code had some errors and inconsistencies. Comments are explaining what was fixed!
      let i = 5; //Semi-colon was missing. The best practice is to always include semi-colon at the end of each JavaScript statement.
      let j = 10; //Semi-colon missing. Same explanation as above.
      let k = 25;
      let l = "Joe"; // Joe is a string type, so it needs to be written inside quotation marks.
      const arr = [3, 5, 7];
      if (i < j) {
        console.log("i");
      } else if (j > k) {
        console.log("k");
      } else {
        console.log("j"); //Quotation mark was missing
      }
      for (let i = 0; i <= 2; ++i) { //Explanation bellow
        console.log(arr[i]);
      }
      // // Array in JS is similar to list in Python, both use indexing starting from 0. In this case loop tried accessing the fourth index that does not exist because i was set to <=3 and Console showed "undefined" after printing existing values. I changed it to i<=2 (meaning 0, 1, 2).
