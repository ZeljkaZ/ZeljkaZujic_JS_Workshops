    <h2>Task description:</h2>
    <p>
      Write a JavaScript function that takes a person's age as an argument and
      returns their age in dog years. Assume one human year is equal to seven
      dog years.
    </p>
    <h3>Hint:</h3>
    <p>
      Function takes input (age), multiplies by 7, returns result. Call it with
      different ages to test.
    </p>

    <!--JavaScript code can be written inside script element or in a separate js file.-->

    <script>
      // This function calculates dog years
      // humanAge is the parametar of the function; it is like a temporary vatiable that can be changed
      // The function return output that is calculated by multiplying humanAge with number 7
      function calculateDogYears(humanAge) {
        return humanAge * 7;
      }

      // Calling the function with different parameters. The output can bee seen in Console
      console.log(calculateDogYears(12));
      console.log(calculateDogYears(5));
      console.log(calculateDogYears(18));
      console.log(calculateDogYears(22));
      console.log(calculateDogYears(68));
    </script>
