    <h1>Loops & Functions Example</h1>

    <p>Check conlsole for the output</p>
    <!-- Loops do something many times, like checking ages from 16 to 20. -->
    <!-- Functions are reusable recipes, like a check age machine. -->

    <script>
      // This function checks if an age is 18 or over
      // Input of this function is age and value is an integer number
      // Output of this function is conditional statement (if - else) and value is Boolean (true or false)
      // This function checks only tell us if a person is 18 or older, or under 18
      function areYouOldEnough(age) {
        if (age >= 18) {
          return true;
        } else {
          return false;
        }
      }

      // This loop checks a few different ages
      // Let's say we are checking the age of a person who is eligible to study at a certain school (all applicants are from from 14 to 25 year old)
      // It starts at 14 and increase by 1 each time (i++ is the same as i+=1) until it reaches number 25.
      // Inside the loop, we call areYouOldEnough function, to filter applicants that are between 18 and 25 year old
      // When loop reaches number 25 it stops.
      // If the condition of the loop is not properly defined, we get infinite loop, which should always be avoided
      // console.log is used here to display results in console

      for (let i = 14; i <= 25; i++) {
        if (areYouOldEnough(i)) {
          console.log("A person of age " + i + " is of accepted age.");
        } else {
          console.log("A person of age " + i + " is NOT of accepted age.");
        }
