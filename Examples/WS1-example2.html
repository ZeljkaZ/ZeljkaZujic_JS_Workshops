    <h1>Conditionals Example</h1>
    <!--Variables hold info like age. Conditionals (if) check conditions and do different things, 
    like checking if someone is old enough for something.-->
    <script>
      // let is used for declaring variable.
      // In this example variable identifier is "age", and value is set to be 80
      let age = 18; // Changing variable's value to for example 33 or 18 displays diferent text on the page

      // const is used for declaring constant variables
      // const variables does not allow changing values
      const order = "Beer";

      // This is conditional statement.
      // If first condition is not fulfilled (if), then we go to the second condition (else if), and then to third (else)
      // Only one of these conditions can be true at the same time
      // In this example, a person can be either over 50, between 20 and 50 or under 20)
      if (age > 50) {
        document.write("<p> He's over 50! </p>");
      } else if (age <= 50 && age > 20) {
        document.write("<p> A man, who ordered some " + order + "</p>");
      } else {
        document.write("<p>It seems you're a bit underaged.</p>");
      }
      // document.write() is used to display the output on the console directly in the HTML page
