    <h1>This is my 1st exercise for Workshop 2</h1> <!-- I added some text there, so that it appears in the browser-->
    <p>Explanation: <strong>document.write</strong> adds text directly to page. Simple but overwrites if used after load.</p>
    <script>
        document.write("Hello, this is my first DOM manipulation exercise.")
        // I used live server to inspect the changes. This line was added under the existing heading and paragraph.
