    <h1>This is my 1st exercise for Workshop 2</h1>
    <!-- I added some text there, so that it appears in the browser-->
    <p>
      Explanation: <strong>document.write</strong> adds text directly to page.
      Simple but overwrites if used after load.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 style="color: red"><strong>Note!</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Here is the demonstration what happens if document.write is used after the
      page is fully loaded
    </p>
    <p>Click on the button to demonstrate.</p>
    <button onclick="document.write('Page replaced!')">Click me</button
    ><br /><br />

    <script>
      document.write("Hello, this is my first DOM manipulation exercise.");
      // I used live server to inspect the changes. This line was added under the existing heading and paragraph.
      // If document.write runs after the page has finished loading, it replaces everything on the page with the new content.
    </script>
