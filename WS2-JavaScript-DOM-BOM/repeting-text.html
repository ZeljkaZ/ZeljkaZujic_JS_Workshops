  <h1>Repeating Text Exercise</h1>
  <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Create <i>repeatingText()</i> to write text 30 times. Explanation: Function reuses code; loop (for) repeats. Call function to run. </p>
  
  <script>
    function repeatingText(){
        for(let i=0; i<30; i++)
        // i is index, so we start at the 0, the loop repeats as long as index is smaler than 30. 
        // if we want text to be repeated 30 times, we could also write i<=29 as a condition. 
        // i++ equals to i+=1 or i=i+1 - it means that index increses by 1 in each iteration
        document.write("Hello! ")
    }
    // Calling the function
    repeatingText()
  </script>
